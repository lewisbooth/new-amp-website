The design still has to be fit for purpose and easy to navigate.</p><p>Benchmarks expose any technical issues to present an objective, detailed breakdown of where your site could improve, thereby enforcing best practices for web developers.</p><p>We consider a PageSpeed score of <strong>at least 80</strong> and a load time of under 1 second to be realistic and beneficial for any website. Top marks aren’t necessary, but there’s no excuse for not following most of the guidelines.</p><p><strong>Developers</strong> — we recommend building at least one website against these metrics, even as a side project. Just understanding them can change the way you code in the future. We’re constantly shocked at how many websites fail to address basic rules like caching and compression that make a huge difference to loading speed!</p><h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2><p>Put simply, a faster, mobile-friendly website directly leads to <strong>more revenue</strong>, <strong>more conversions</strong>, <strong>better SEO ranking</strong> and <strong>more time spent</strong> on your site.</p><p>If you’re selling products or trying to convert leads, optimising your site’s loading speed should be your first priority.

Users browse longer, view more pages and are more likely to return if a website is fast, all of which affects SEO. Google intend to start by only penalising the slowest websites, but the direction that they’re moving is obvious.</p><p>It’s quickly becoming table stakes to have a fast mobile-responsive website, and competitors who invest in the area will quickly gain an edge over slower sites.</p><h3 id="lost-visitors--bounce-rates">Lost visitors &amp; bounce rates</h3><p>According to <a href="https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters/" target="blank">DoubleClick by Google</a>, more than <strong>50% of visitors abandon a website</strong> during the first 3 seconds of loading, affecting your revenue and SEO rank.

That’s the last thing you need when your products get featured on a popular blog!</p><h2 id="why-are-websites-so-slow-">Why are websites so slow? 🐌</h2><p>There are dozens of technical reasons for slow websites, but in our experience it comes down to tight deadlines, over-prescription of WordPress for cheap/quick projects (leading to the dreaded plugin/theme hell) or developers just being lazy.</p><h3 id="not-testing-on-slow-devices">Not testing on slow devices</h3><p>Many developers are accustomed to testing their work over fast broadband connections on a high-end development computer, but neglect to test on an old Android phone over 3G internet.</p><p>We once audited a website for a popular restaurant that took 4 seconds to load on a 2017 MacBook using our office broadband, but 35 seconds over 3G. Why would your customers wait 35 seconds to find a phone number?!</p><h3 id="avoiding-the-problem">Avoiding the problem</h3><p>Slow loading is glossed over by clients and developers alike, because it’s a messy problem that’s <strong>easy to sweep under the rug</strong>, especially once the project is already underway. Few clients want to spend their budget on tweaking the loading times when there are features to be added!</p><p>Just like avoiding chores it’s a nagging problem that builds over time until facing it becomes a large upfront cost, but if controlled and built in from the start it’s easily manageable.</p><h3 id="lazy-developers">Lazy developers</h3><p>It’s developer’s job to set up hosting correctly, keep on top of a site’s performance and ensure that modern standards are met. Unfortunately we come across websites every single day that are hamstrung by misconfigured servers, uncompressed images and bad coding.</p><p>These things can be fixed quickly and should have been set up in the first place, but are overlooked due to lack of awareness, tight deadlines or just laziness — as long as it <em>works</em>, the client can’t tell if a server is set up badly.</p><h3 id="wordpress--cms-bloat">WordPress &amp; CMS bloat</h3><p>Popular CMS and e-commerce platforms such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="blank">WordPress</a>, <a href="https://woocommerce.com/" target="blank">WooCommerce</a>, <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="blank">SquareSpace</a>, <a href="https://magento.com/" target="blank">Magento</a> and <a href="https://www.shopify.co.uk/" target="blank">Shopify</a> offer great tools for building websites and are used as the default option by many agencies, but they often run on enormous code bases that are slow to load and grow <strong>more sluggish over time</strong> due to 3rd party plugins, heavy themes and layers of upgrades.</p><p>It’s common to see developers install fully-featured plugins and themes to solve simple tasks, saving their own time at the cost of their end users’ frustration. Eventually this grows into a soul-sucking, tangled mess that becomes painful to work with, where modifying plugins feels like disabling a bomb that could bring the whole site down at any point.</p><p>It’s possible to <a href="https://www.keycdn.com/blog/google-pagespeed-insights-wordpress/" target="blank">optimise WordPress</a> and even achieve 100 PageSpeed score, but it rarely works out that way. Developers have to spend extra time and budget fighting against the inbuilt mess rather than working with it.</p><p>More modern alternatives include <a href="https://getgrav.org/" target="blank">Grav</a>, <a href="https://grabaperch.com/" target="blank">Perch</a> and <a href="https://craftcms.com/" target="blank">Craft</a>, though these options have fewer pre-made themes and plugins.</p><p>We sometimes build 100% bespoke content management systems using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="blank">NodeJS</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="blank">MongoDB</a>/<a href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="blank">MySQL</a> and <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="blank">Express</a>, which are tailored for client needs and lightning fast.

If you have any questions just <a href="https://amp.studio/contact/" target="blank">reach out</a> to us, we’ll talk your ears off about this topic all day.</p><p>If you want a thorough checklist for development, David Dias’ <a href="https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Checklist" target="blank">Front-End Checklist</a> is a great place to start.</p><p>Start by running your website through <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="blank">Google PageSpeed Insights</a> , which results in a detailed list of where your website could improve, along with tutorials and a useful .zip of your optimised images and CSS/JS assets.</p><p>Here’s the overview in rough order of priority, then we’ll break the topics down individually:</p><p><strong>Configure your web server</strong></p><ul><li>Cache static content</li><li>Enable gzip compression</li><li>HTTP/2 &amp; SSL</li><li>Use a CDN</li></ul><p><strong>Compress images</strong></p><ul><li>Reduce file size</li><li>Use responsive images</li><li>Use compression plugins</li></ul><p><strong>Optimise CSS &amp; JS</strong></p><ul><li>Strip unnecessary code</li><li>Scrap jQuery</li><li>Async load JavaScript</li></ul><p><strong>Reduce HTTP requests</strong></p><ul><li>Bundle &amp; minify assets</li><li>Lazy load content</li><li>Use sprite sheets</li><li>Watch your WordPress plugins</li></ul><p><strong>Prioritise visible content</strong></p><ul><li>Inline critical CSS &amp; JS</li><li>Set above-the-fold dimensions in CSS</li><li>Optimise the waterfall</li></ul><p><strong>Reduce time-to-first-byte</strong></p><ul><li>Cache dynamic content</li><li>Check server latency</li><li>Try a static site generator</li></ul><h3 id="configure-your-web-server">Configure your web server</h3><p>Your web server is the perfect place to start optimising, because sometimes all it takes is a single line or block of code to make a huge difference.</p><p>Start by taking control of your hosting — we host in the cloud using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="blank">Amazon Web Services</a>, or <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="blank">DigitalOcean</a> is a great alternative.</p><p>Sometimes clients will buy a domain name with shared hosting included, but these packages are limited in terms of speed, location and configuration. They also add extra management overhead when it comes to switching between projects.</p><p>We prefer using <a href="https://www.nginx.com/" target="blank">Nginx</a> installed on a Ubuntu EC2 instance which hosts multiple websites, and we’ll use this setup for the following sections. This way we can control exactly where our server is, how powerful it needs to be, what software is installed, how it’s configured and what’s being hosted on it.</p><p>When you’ve made any changes to the config files, remember to use the following command to reload the config:</p><div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>service nginx restart
</code></pre></div></div><h4 id="cache-static-content">Cache static content</h4><p>When a browser wants to download an external resource such as an image or script, it checks a local cache to see if it’s been downloaded recently.</p><p>You can control the exact amount of time that each file stays in the user’s browser cache before expiring by setting the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cache-Control</code> HTTP header. If no header is set, the browser will <strong>re-download the file on every page</strong>, which slows performance unnecessarily. This header alone can greatly speed up a website.</p><p>Here’s how I set a maximum expiry date inside an Nginx server block:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>location ~* \.(?:css|js|jpg|jpeg|gif|png|ico|cur|gz|svg|svgz|mp4|ogg|ogv|webm|htc|woff|woff2|ttf|otf)$ {
  expires 1y;
  access_log off;
  add_header Cache-Control "public";
}
</code></pre></div></div><p>With this setup the browser will keep static files for a year before re-downloading them. You’ll need to cache files for at least a week before PageSpeed stops yelling about it.</p><p>Just be aware that if you update the files on your server, browsers that have already cached the file will keep using their outdated version. To force a reload, you can change the name of the URL or version it manually with a query string like so:</p><div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">“/script.js?v=1.0”</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>It’s also possible to add a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-hash" target="blank">file hash</a> to the URL using Gulp for automatic versioning.</p><p>You can’t control the cache duration for files that you don’t host, such as scripts or fonts loaded from an official repository. It’s usually best to try and host them yourself, but some resources like Google Analytics need to be loaded from Google servers which set a 2 hour expiry time, knocking 1 point from your PageSpeed Insights score.</p><h4 id="enable-gzip-compression">Enable gzip compression</h4><p><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/optimize-encoding-and-transfer" target="blank">gzip</a> tells your server to compress text assets like HTML, CSS and JS before sending them across the network, reducing their size by <strong>up to 90%!</strong> There’s really no reason to have this disabled, and it’s included in all modern web servers.</p><p>Find your <code class="highlighter-rouge">nginx.conf</code> file and make sure this line isn’t commented out with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">#</code>:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>gzip on;
</code></pre></div></div><p>Although not required, you can add <code class="highlighter-rouge">gzip_min_length 256;</code> on a new line to avoid compressing tiny files that don’t benefit from gzip. The rest of the gzip lines are fine staying commented out unless you want to change them.</p><h4 id="http2-and-ssl">HTTP/2 and SSL</h4><p>Back in ye olde days of 2015, HTTP/1.1 was the protocol that all websites used to transfer files. It was released in 1999, and was quickly becoming a bottleneck for speed due to being designed for simpler times.</p><p><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/http2/" target="blank">HTTP/2</a> brings a huge speed boost to the underlying protocol of the internet. It’s backwards compatible and easy to set up so it should be used by default for all new sites.</p><ul><li><strong>Multiplexing</strong> — Many requests can be made at the same time over the same connection, previously only 6 files could be downloaded at once</li><li><strong>Single TCP connection</strong> — Just one persistent connection is needed to download all website resources, rather than a new one for every file</li><li><strong>File priority</strong> — The server can prioritise some requests above others</li><li><strong>Server push</strong> — The server can push files to the client without them requesting it, usually files that they’ll need later</li><li><strong>Header compression</strong> — Saves bandwidth rather than re-sending the same headers with every request</li></ul><p>Here’s a basic HTTP/2 Nginx set up to go inside your server block. The only difference is the inclusion of <code class="highlighter-rouge">http2</code> in each listen line.</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>listen 80 default_server;
listen [::]:80 default_server;
listen 443 ssl http2 default_server;

// Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
if ($scheme != "https") {
  return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
</code></pre></div></div><p>All HTTP/2 connections <strong>require SSL encryption</strong> to work, but with the rise of <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="blank">Let’s Encrypt</a> you can do this for free in about 2 minutes. If you have SSH access to your server, <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/" target="blank">Certbot</a> will automagically detect the websites you’re hosting, generate and install your certificates, update your server config and renew your certificates every 90 days… we love automation 🤖</p><p>Certbot is super easy to install on Ubuntu via SSH:</p><div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt install certbot
<span class="nb">sudo </span>certbot

If the files have expired or they’re not in the cache, they are fetched the origin server and forwarded on to the user. This is ideal if you have heavy traffic or visitors from around the world trying to access your content.</p><p>CDNs take a huge amount of load off your web server and can handle <strong>virtually unlimited traffic</strong>, so they’re perfect for serving up images, videos, scripts and other static content.</p><p>You can also cache dynamic HTML responses, even if it’s for 1 second, so that your server isn’t crushed by a flood of traffic.</p><p>A slight downside is that it can take up to half an hour to force a re-distribution of cached files that haven’t yet expired. We also tested CloudFront for our website and found that the page actually loaded ~100ms slower than when hosted directly on our Ubuntu server.</p><h3 id="compress-images">Compress images</h3><p>Most websites have some level of image bloat, and in the worst cases multiple photos are uploaded straight out of the camera weighing 5-10MB or more.

</code></pre></div></div><h4 id="watch-your-wordpress-plugins">Watch your WordPress plugins</h4><p>WordPress (noticing a theme here?) plugins are notorious for loading masses of extra code into the browser, and it’s hard to weed them back out without breaking things. We recently came across a brand new WordPress site for an agency that <em>sells website development</em>. Here’s just one portion of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;head&gt;</code> code:</p><p><img src="/assets/img/blog/pagespeed/image-5.png" alt="How not to load website resources" title="How not to load website resources"></p><p>In total, there are 53 Javascript and 33 CSS files which block the page and take a full 6 seconds to load on Virgin’s fastest 400Mbit broadband, and <strong>44 seconds</strong> on 3G internet. The page has a 1.2 second TTFB, no <code class="highlighter-rouge">gzip</code> and no <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cache-Control</code> header so all of the assets are uncompressed and re-downloaded on every page! 😡😡😡</p><p>A staggering portion of these are coming from a single 3rd party Instagram feed plugin, yet the page has no Instagram content. 🤔</p><p>Audit your plugins!</p><h3 id="prioritise-visible-content">Prioritise visible content</h3><p>Pay close attention to the order in which your CSS, JS and images are loading, and try to minimise the time it takes for the browser to render above-the-fold content. Google have <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/" target="blank">excellent advice</a> for optimising the critical render path.</p><h4 id="inline-critical-css--js">Inline critical CSS &amp; JS</h4><p>If your CSS weighs less than 100KB or so we recommend just inlining the minified version directly into the HTML using Gulp or your templating system of choice. This way the browser can instantly start laying out the page with the just first HTML response rather than waiting for an external file request to return, and the page feels much snappier as a result.</p><p>See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk" target="blank">The Guardian’s</a> recently redesigned website for an example of inlining the main payload of CSS.</p><p>With this method you don’t get the benefit of having CSS cached in the browser because it’s re-downloaded on every page, but once gzipped 100KB of CSS turns into ~15KB and is transferred in an instant. We’re still seeing &lt; 200ms load times with this approach. If you’re able to separate your above-the-fold CSS and just inline that part, go for it!</p><p>We also inline most of our small JavaScript files to reduce HTTP requests and increase the overall page speed.</p><h4 id="set-above-the-fold-dimensions-in-css">Set above-the-fold dimensions in CSS</h4><p>Everybody’s tried to click on something the <em>instant</em> after an advert or image pops in causing the page to re-arrange itself, and felt the internal rage that follows as you mash the back button too many times.</p><p>I spent hours trying to figure out why PageSpeed Insights was knocking my score down for Prioritise Visible Content, and this turned out to be the reason (and an important lesson).</p><p>If you have images above the fold, make sure the height attribute is clearly defined in your CSS. By default the browser will render the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;img&gt;</code> element at 0 height until the image file loads, at which point it will calculate the width/height ratio and resize the element to fit, causing the page content to jump around.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/blog/pagespeed/image-6.jpg" alt="MSD vehicles website paints" title="MSD vehicles website paints"></p><p>Notice on the <a href="https://amp.studio/portfolio/2017/msd-vehicles/" target="blank">MSD Vehicles</a> website how even before the text and images have loaded, the page is laid out with exactly the right dimensions to accommodate them. This doesn’t strictly make the page load faster, but it <em>feels</em> faster once you’ve done it because the content blocks are visually in place sooner. The final paint happens in just 140ms because we’ve spent time optimising for visible content.</p><p>You can use the Network tab in Chrome’s developer tools to <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/" target="blank">capture screenshots</a> of each paint stage and analyse where content is jumping around, and try to fix the dimensions in CSS.</p><p>This also goes for advertising blocks. <em>Especially</em> for advertising blocks.</p><h4 id="optimise-the-waterfall">Optimise the waterfall</h4><p>Most browser developer tools have a Network tab that shows a waterfall graph of all the HTTP requests made whilst the tab is set to record, along with details of the file sizes, number of requests and loading times for different stages. It’s extremely useful for analysing the order in which files are requested and spotting issues.</p><p>In the Network tab, you can turn off your browser cache to force all assets to re-download and artificially limit your network speed to simulate mobile devices on 3G and see how that affects the graph.</p><p>Here’s the AMP homepage waterfall in Chrome, without the video that streams in afterwards:</p><p><img src="/assets/img/blog/pagespeed/image-7.png" alt="AMP homepage waterfall in Chrome" title="AMP homepage waterfall in Chrome"></p><p>Most of the HTTP requests are made in bulk as early as possible because they’re included in the first HTML response, resulting in a 233ms load time for this particular page.</p><p>Inlining CSS allows the browser to request background images, icons and fonts immediately, rather than waiting for the external CSS to download, parse and request the files in a second round.</p><p>This is where HTTP/2 helps massively, allowing us to process hundreds of files in one go. When using HTTP/1.1 the requests get bottlenecked and staggered across time due to a limit of 6 requests.</p><p>The 4 font files at the top load in earlier than everything else because we’ve added preload links to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;head&gt;</code>, before the inlined CSS. This helps the text to render as early as possible in <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=preload" target="blank">supported browsers</a>.

For the Twitter feed on our otherwise static homepage, we pull the data in via AJAX from a custom API.</p><p>Our own website has a ~25ms TTFB when deployed because the pages are already rendered into static HTML files, so the web server can instantly respond without processing any PHP or backend logic.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Whew, that was a long one.</p><p>Hopefully this post encourages clients and developers alike to start taking speed seriously when it comes to increasing the revenue and SEO ranking of a website.</p><p>We’re barely scratching the surface and each topic could easily be a post on its own, so <a href="https://amp.studio/contact" target="blank">email us</a> or reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/ampstudiouk" target="blank">Twitter</a> with any questions or comments.</p></div></section><section class="post-footer pm"><div class="container"><div class="post-footer-author"><img src="/assets/img/lewis-thumb1.jpg" alt="test"><p>Posted by Lewis Booth<br><a href="/blog/tutorials/">in tutorials</a></p></div><div class="vertical-break"></div><div class="post-footer-share"><p>Share This Article:</p><div class="footer-info-navigation-social"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://amp.studio/blog/tutorials/2018/pagespeed-insights/&text=Why Slow Websites Lose Customers, And How To Fix Them&via=AMPstudioUK&" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/img/twitter-grey.svg"> </a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://amp.studio/blog/tutorials/2018/pagespeed-insights/" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/img/facebook-grey.svg"> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://amp.studio/blog/tutorials/2018/pagespeed-insights/&title=Why Slow Websites Lose Customers, And How To Fix Them&summary=&source=https%3A//www.linkedin.com/company/18133628/" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/img/linkedin-grey.svg"></a></div></div></div></section><section class="blog-feed post-blog-feed pl"><div class="container"><div class="line-break"></div><div class="blog-feed-title"><h2>More Posts&nbsp;<br class="show-600">in Tutorials</h2><a href="/blog/" class="text-link"><span>All Posts</span> <span><img src="/assets/img/arrow-pink.svg"></span></a></div><div class="blog-feed-container"><div class="blog-feed-post"><a class="blog-feed-post-wrapper" href="/blog/tutorials/2018/responsive-emails-mjml/"></a> <img class="ms" src="/assets/img/blog/mjml.svg" alt="Building responsive emails with MJML."> <a class="blog-tag format-tag">tutorials</a></div></div></div></section><footer><div class="footer-bg"></div><div class="container footer-info-container"><div class="footer-info"><div class="footer-info-cta"><h2>Let's get down to business.</h2><a class="button-1 dark" href="/contact/"><span>Start a Project</span> <span><img src="/assets/img/arrow-white.svg"></span></a></div><div class="footer-info-navigation"><div class="footer-info-navigation-list"><h3>Contact us</h3><p>Burslem Enterprise Centre<br>Moorland Road<br>Burslem<br>Stoke-on-Trent<br>ST6 1JQ</p></div><div class="footer-info-navigation-social"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ampstudiouk/" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/img/instagram-white.svg"> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/ampstudiouk" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/img/twitter-white.svg"> </a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ampstudiouk/" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/img/facebook-white.svg"> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/18133628/" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/img/linkedin-white.svg"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="footer-break"></div><div class="container"><div class="footer-copyright"><a href="/"><img src="/assets/img/sticky-logo.svg" alt="AMP Logo"></a><div class="footer-copyright-links"><p>© AMP Studio 2017.
