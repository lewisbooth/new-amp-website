Most digital marketing companies spend weeks of effort and thousands of pounds on paid search campaigns, generating SEO strategies, posting on social media and building landing pages to squeeze out a few percent more conversions.

All of these things are worthwhile, but often overlook a core problem that’s easy to fix and makes a drastic impact on revenue — your website’s loading speed!

&gt; [“There’s no beating around the bush anymore: you should work on making your site as fast and accessible as possible. Don’t wait, do it now. I mean it. Work on your mobile SEO.&quot;](#){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}

Every millisecond is an opportunity for users leave your site in frustration, and it happens more than you might expect. **If your web pages take more than half a second to load, revenue is being lost.** After crossing 3 seconds, 50% of your visitors may have [already left](https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} before viewing the page!

Slow websites can be caused by everything from lazy developers to rogue plugins, content management systems, tight deadlines, lack of awareness and bad server configuration, and can severely hamstring the revenue potential of your website.

We’re often challenged by our clients to explain the _value_ in spending extra time optimising for speed, so we’ve written this post as an in-depth guide laying out the problems facing bloated websites, why clients should care and how developers can set up their websites and servers for maximum effectiveness.

Reach out to us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ampstudiouk){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} if you have any questions or tips for us.

## Setting high standards

We build our websites for [ludicrous speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygE01sOhzz0){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}. As a baseline, we aim for **[100/100 Google PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Famp.studio){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}** ranking and a load time of **under 300 milliseconds** (top 1% of all sites) in Google Chrome desktop over a good UK broadband connection. We also use [Pingdom](https://tools.pingdom.com/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} and [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} for additional testing.

![AMP website PageSpeed Insights](/assets/img/blog/pagespeed/image-1.jpg &quot;AMP website PageSpeed Insights&quot;)

Call it overkill, but there’s a huge difference in conversions when a website is literally 10x faster than it’s competitors, and if you build for speed from the start it’s not too difficult to do.

### Why benchmarks matter

Of course, **benchmarks are not the measure of a good website**, nor should they be a primary focus for the client. The design still has to be fit for purpose and easy to navigate.

Benchmarks expose any technical issues to present an objective, detailed breakdown of where your site could improve, thereby enforcing best practices for web developers.

We consider a PageSpeed score of **at least 80** and a load time of under 1 second to be realistic and beneficial for any website. Top marks aren’t necessary, but there’s no excuse for not following most of the guidelines.

**Developers** — we recommend building at least one website against these metrics, even as a side project. Just understanding them can change the way you code in the future. We’re constantly shocked at how many websites fail to address basic rules like caching and compression that make a huge difference to loading speed!

## So what?

Put simply, a faster, mobile-friendly website directly leads to **more revenue**, **more conversions**, **better SEO ranking** and **more time spent** on your site.

If you’re selling products or trying to convert leads, optimising your site’s loading speed should be your first priority. You can’t capture customers if they’re leaving in frustration!

Watch Maile Ohye’s [Site Performance For Webmasters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpMfx_Zie2g){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} for a chart-filled dive into how loading times affect e-commerce sales (spoiler: it matters a _lot_).

### Direct revenue gains

Even before the mobile internet boom, the internet giants were [testing relentlessly](https://www.slideshare.net/stoyan/yslow-20-presentation/4-The_importance_of_performance_ulli500){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} to make sure that their web pages performed optimally. Many of them have written about how faster pages substantially increase their metrics.

* Amazon gains 1% more sales for every 100ms decrease in loading time
* Google lost 20% of their traffic by adding 500ms to their loading time
* The BBC loses [10% of their visitors](http://www.creativebloq.com/features/how-the-bbc-builds-websites-that-scale) for every second of load time
* Trainline boosted sales by [£8 million per year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ai-6qwT6ES8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=462){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} with a 300ms speed-up
* Yahoo suffered up to a 9% drop in traffic from a 400ms increase in loading time
* Facebook saw up to [25% more page views](https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=122869103919){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} and higher engagement in casual users after speeding up their news feed
* AliExpress [gained](https://edge.akamai.com/ec/us/highlights/keynote-speakers.jsp#edge2016futureofcommercemodal){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} 10.5% more orders and a 27% increase in conversion rates for new customers after shaving 36% off their load times

### Conversion Rates

Walmart’s internal [research](http://www.webperformancetoday.com/2012/02/28/4-awesome-slides-showing-how-page-speed-correlates-to-business-metrics-at-walmart-com/) shows a clear decline in conversions due to higher loading times. Note the huge drop-off from 1-2 seconds!

![Walmart website insights](/assets/img/blog/pagespeed/image-2.png &quot;Walmart website insights&quot;)

TagMan found that every second of delay can cause a huge [7% drop](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} in sales. This can easily amount to thousands or millions of pounds lost every year for an e-commerce website, and sometimes a single line in a configuration file is all it takes to re-capture it.

### SEO Ranking

As of July 2018 Google will [penalise slow loading times](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search.html?m=1){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} on mobile in addition to desktop searches, and they already index for [mobile-friendly layouts](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/mobile-first-indexing.html){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} first in their search rankings.

&gt; [“People want to be able to find answers to their questions as fast as possible — studies show that people really care about the speed of a page… today we’re announcing that starting in July 2018, page speed will be a ranking factor for mobile searches&quot;](#){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}

{: .source}
[Google](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search.html?m=1){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}, 2018

It makes sense — mobile devices took over [50% share of page views](https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} globally last year, and the impact of loading speed is more obvious on slow mobile networks. Users browse longer, view more pages and are more likely to return if a website is fast, all of which affects SEO. Google intend to start by only penalising the slowest websites, but the direction that they’re moving is obvious.

It’s quickly becoming table stakes to have a fast mobile-responsive website, and competitors who invest in the area will quickly gain an edge over slower sites.

### Lost visitors &amp; bounce rates

According to [DoubleClick by Google](https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}, more than **50% of visitors abandon a website** during the first 3 seconds of loading, affecting your revenue and SEO rank. Given that the average mobile site takes over [19 seconds](https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} to load, there’s a good chance that your site is leaking visitors that could easily be recovered with a few tweaks.

![DoubleClick by Google](/assets/img/blog/pagespeed/image-3.png &quot;DoubleClick by Google&quot;)

Visitors are more likely to browse around your website, find what they’re looking for and stay for longer if your pages load quickly, leading to lower bounce rates and improving SEO rank.

Additionally, Google Analytics found that mobile websites that load in 5 seconds compared to 19 seconds [gain](https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}:

* Up to 100% more ad revenue
* 25% higher ad viewability
* 70% longer average sessions
* 35% lower bounce rates

It’s clear from Google’s own research that any time shaved off a page’s loading speed makes a difference to the number of people who stick around, leading to more conversions, lower bounce rates and a higher SEO ranking.

&gt; [“Whilst increased conversions and revenue are more than sufficient reasons to make this an area of investment, other benefits that cannot be overlooked include increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, confidence and trust.&quot;](#){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}

### Lower operating costs

A well-optimised website uses much less bandwidth and server resources than a bloated one, resulting in lower hosting charges and the ability to handle more traffic. This is great on busy e-commerce websites where hosting can cost hundreds or thousands of pounds per month.

### No more crashing

Even a small web server can handle thousands of simple requests per second, but a bloated WordPress or Magento site can become overwhelmed under a small burst of visitors, even if it’s only 10 people clicking around at one time. That’s the last thing you need when your products get featured on a popular blog!

## Why are websites so slow? 🐌

There are dozens of technical reasons for slow websites, but in our experience it comes down to tight deadlines, over-prescription of WordPress for cheap/quick projects (leading to the dreaded plugin/theme hell) or developers just being lazy.

### Not testing on slow devices

Many developers are accustomed to testing their work over fast broadband connections on a high-end development computer, but neglect to test on an old Android phone over 3G internet.

We once audited a website for a popular restaurant that took 4 seconds to load on a 2017 MacBook using our office broadband, but 35 seconds over 3G. Why would your customers wait 35 seconds to find a phone number?!

### Avoiding the problem

Slow loading is glossed over by clients and developers alike, because it’s a messy problem that’s **easy to sweep under the rug**, especially once the project is already underway. Few clients want to spend their budget on tweaking the loading times when there are features to be added!

Just like avoiding chores it’s a nagging problem that builds over time until facing it becomes a large upfront cost, but if controlled and built in from the start it’s easily manageable.

### Lazy developers

It’s developer’s job to set up hosting correctly, keep on top of a site’s performance and ensure that modern standards are met. Unfortunately we come across websites every single day that are hamstrung by misconfigured servers, uncompressed images and bad coding.

These things can be fixed quickly and should have been set up in the first place, but are overlooked due to lack of awareness, tight deadlines or just laziness — as long as it _works_, the client can’t tell if a server is set up badly.

### WordPress &amp; CMS bloat

Popular CMS and e-commerce platforms such as [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}, [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}, [SquareSpace](https://www.squarespace.com/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}, [Magento](https://magento.com/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} and [Shopify](https://www.shopify.co.uk/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} offer great tools for building websites and are used as the default option by many agencies, but they often run on enormous code bases that are slow to load and grow **more sluggish over time** due to 3rd party plugins, heavy themes and layers of upgrades.

It’s common to see developers install fully-featured plugins and themes to solve simple tasks, saving their own time at the cost of their end users’ frustration. Eventually this grows into a soul-sucking, tangled mess that becomes painful to work with, where modifying plugins feels like disabling a bomb that could bring the whole site down at any point.

It’s possible to [optimise WordPress](https://www.keycdn.com/blog/google-pagespeed-insights-wordpress/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} and even achieve 100 PageSpeed score, but it rarely works out that way. Developers have to spend extra time and budget fighting against the inbuilt mess rather than working with it.

More modern alternatives include [Grav](https://getgrav.org/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}, [Perch](https://grabaperch.com/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} and [Craft](https://craftcms.com/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}, though these options have fewer pre-made themes and plugins.

We sometimes build 100% bespoke content management systems using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}/[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} and [Express](https://expressjs.com/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}, which are tailored for client needs and lightning fast. Our [MSD Vehicles](https://amp.studio/portfolio/2017/msd-vehicles/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} hire/sales website can finish loading in the browser in _less than 200ms_ under normal conditions when deployed, even with a database of users and vehicles.

## How to speed up your website

Now for the good stuff — we’ll run through the most common methods of increasing website performance and how developers can implement them. If you have any questions just [reach out](https://amp.studio/contact/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} to us, we’ll talk your ears off about this topic all day.

If you want a thorough checklist for development, David Dias’ [Front-End Checklist](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Checklist){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} is a great place to start.

Start by running your website through [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} , which results in a detailed list of where your website could improve, along with tutorials and a useful .zip of your optimised images and CSS/JS assets.

Here’s the overview in rough order of priority, then we’ll break the topics down individually:

**Configure your web server**

* Cache static content
* Enable gzip compression
* HTTP/2 &amp; SSL
* Use a CDN

**Compress images**

* Reduce file size
* Use responsive images
* Use compression plugins

**Optimise CSS &amp; JS**

* Strip unnecessary code
* Scrap jQuery
* Async load JavaScript

**Reduce HTTP requests**

* Bundle &amp; minify assets
* Lazy load content
* Use sprite sheets
* Watch your WordPress plugins

**Prioritise visible content**

* Inline critical CSS &amp; JS
* Set above-the-fold dimensions in CSS
* Optimise the waterfall

**Reduce time-to-first-byte**

* Cache dynamic content
* Check server latency
* Try a static site generator

### Configure your web server

Your web server is the perfect place to start optimising, because sometimes all it takes is a single line or block of code to make a huge difference.

Start by taking control of your hosting — we host in the cloud using [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}, or [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} is a great alternative.

Sometimes clients will buy a domain name with shared hosting included, but these packages are limited in terms of speed, location and configuration. They also add extra management overhead when it comes to switching between projects.

We prefer using [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} installed on a Ubuntu EC2 instance which hosts multiple websites, and we’ll use this setup for the following sections. This way we can control exactly where our server is, how powerful it needs to be, what software is installed, how it’s configured and what’s being hosted on it.

When you’ve made any changes to the config files, remember to use the following command to reload the config:

```bash
sudo service nginx restart
```

#### Cache static content

When a browser wants to download an external resource such as an image or script, it checks a local cache to see if it’s been downloaded recently.

You can control the exact amount of time that each file stays in the user’s browser cache before expiring by setting the `Cache-Control` HTTP header. If no header is set, the browser will **re-download the file on every page**, which slows performance unnecessarily. This header alone can greatly speed up a website.

Here’s how I set a maximum expiry date inside an Nginx server block:

```
location ~* \.(?:css|js|jpg|jpeg|gif|png|ico|cur|gz|svg|svgz|mp4|ogg|ogv|webm|htc|woff|woff2|ttf|otf)$ {
  expires 1y;
  access_log off;
  add_header Cache-Control &quot;public&quot;;
}
```

With this setup the browser will keep static files for a year before re-downloading them. You’ll need to cache files for at least a week before PageSpeed stops yelling about it.

Just be aware that if you update the files on your server, browsers that have already cached the file will keep using their outdated version. To force a reload, you can change the name of the URL or version it manually with a query string like so:

```html
&lt;script src=“/script.js?v=1.0”&gt;
```

It’s also possible to add a [file hash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-hash){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} to the URL using Gulp for automatic versioning.

You can’t control the cache duration for files that you don’t host, such as scripts or fonts loaded from an official repository. It’s usually best to try and host them yourself, but some resources like Google Analytics need to be loaded from Google servers which set a 2 hour expiry time, knocking 1 point from your PageSpeed Insights score.

#### Enable gzip compression

[gzip](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/optimize-encoding-and-transfer){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} tells your server to compress text assets like HTML, CSS and JS before sending them across the network, reducing their size by **up to 90%!** There’s really no reason to have this disabled, and it’s included in all modern web servers.

Find your `nginx.conf` file and make sure this line isn’t commented out with a `#`:

```
gzip on;
```

Although not required, you can add `gzip_min_length 256;` on a new line to avoid compressing tiny files that don’t benefit from gzip. The rest of the gzip lines are fine staying commented out unless you want to change them.

#### HTTP/2 and SSL

Back in ye olde days of 2015, HTTP/1.1 was the protocol that all websites used to transfer files. It was released in 1999, and was quickly becoming a bottleneck for speed due to being designed for simpler times.

[HTTP/2](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/http2/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} brings a huge speed boost to the underlying protocol of the internet. It’s backwards compatible and easy to set up so it should be used by default for all new sites.

* **Multiplexing** — Many requests can be made at the same time over the same connection, previously only 6 files could be downloaded at once
* **Single TCP connection** — Just one persistent connection is needed to download all website resources, rather than a new one for every file
* **File priority** — The server can prioritise some requests above others
* **Server push** — The server can push files to the client without them requesting it, usually files that they’ll need later
* **Header compression** — Saves bandwidth rather than re-sending the same headers with every request

Here’s a basic HTTP/2 Nginx set up to go inside your server block. The only difference is the inclusion of `http2` in each listen line.

```
listen 80 default_server;
listen [::]:80 default_server;
listen 443 ssl http2 default_server;
listen [::]:443 ssl http2 default_server;

// Certbot will take care of everything below this
ssl_certificate path_to_cert.pem
ssl_certificate_key path_to_key.pem;

// Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
if ($scheme != &quot;https&quot;) {
  return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

All HTTP/2 connections **require SSL encryption** to work, but with the rise of [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} you can do this for free in about 2 minutes. If you have SSH access to your server, [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} will automagically detect the websites you’re hosting, generate and install your certificates, update your server config and renew your certificates every 90 days… we love automation 🤖

Certbot is super easy to install on Ubuntu via SSH:

```bash
sudo apt install certbot
sudo certbot
```

The `certbot` command will give you a list of any websites that it can detect on your server, ask you which ones you want to secure and whether you want to redirect all traffic to HTTPS (which you probably should). It’s as easy as that! If you run into problems, the [official documentation](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/intro.html#installation){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} covers manual setup.

#### Use a CDN

A Content Delivery Network such as [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} or [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} sits in front of your main web server (called the origin), distributing its content to dozens of cache locations around the world.

![AWS CloudFront cache locations](/assets/img/blog/pagespeed/image-4.png &quot;AWS CloudFront cache locations&quot;)

{: .source}
AWS CloudFront [cache locations](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/details/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}, 2018

When a user visits your website, they are routed to the nearest cache which serves your static files if it has them. If the files have expired or they’re not in the cache, they are fetched the origin server and forwarded on to the user. This is ideal if you have heavy traffic or visitors from around the world trying to access your content.

CDNs take a huge amount of load off your web server and can handle **virtually unlimited traffic**, so they’re perfect for serving up images, videos, scripts and other static content.

You can also cache dynamic HTML responses, even if it’s for 1 second, so that your server isn’t crushed by a flood of traffic.

A slight downside is that it can take up to half an hour to force a re-distribution of cached files that haven’t yet expired. We also tested CloudFront for our website and found that the page actually loaded ~100ms slower than when hosted directly on our Ubuntu server.

### Compress images

Most websites have some level of image bloat, and in the worst cases multiple photos are uploaded straight out of the camera weighing 5-10MB or more. We’ve seen a gallery with 50 images serving full camera resolution images as the thumbnails for a 220MB total page size 🤦‍♂️

#### Reduce file size

Saving your images in the correct format at the exact size they will be displayed is crucial. Photoshop and Sketch have great tools for this, and setting the JPEG quality to 50 is usually enough.

Another option is to save your images at max quality with the correct dimensions, then run them through an online tool like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} or [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}.

* **JPEG** — photos and soft edges
* **PNG** — hard lines, text and solid colours, reduce the number of colours to the minimum without banding
* **SVG** — vector-based logos, illustrations and animations, use over PNG where possible
* **MP4** — any video or animated content
* **GIF** — probably never due to massive file sizes, use PNG for stills and MP4 for animations

#### Use responsive images

Loading optimised versions of the same image for each screen size can be a big bandwidth saver. No need to load a 2000px banner image for a mobile site! It’s possible to shave seconds off your mobile load times with these methods.

The `&lt;picture&gt;` tag can set different image sources using CSS media queries. Old browsers will fall back to the nested `&lt;img&gt;` tag.

```html
&lt;picture&gt;
  &lt;source srcset=&quot;mobile_banner.jpg&quot; media=&quot;(max-width: 400px)&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source srcset=&quot;small_banner.jpg&quot; media=&quot;(max-width: 768px)&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source srcset=&quot;med_banner.jpg&quot; media=&quot;(max-width: 1024px)&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source srcset=&quot;dektop_banner.jpg&quot; media=&quot;(min-width: 1025px)&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img srcset=&quot;dektop_banner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Banner Image&quot;&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
```

You can use `max-width`, `min-width`, `max-height`, `min-height`, `orientation` and more in the media queries.

It’s also possible to do a simpler version inside a single `&lt;img&gt;` tag:

```html
&lt;img src=&quot;mobile_banner.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;small_banner.jpg 1.8x, med_banner.jpg 2.5x desktop_banner.jpg 3.5x&quot; alt=&quot;Banner Image&quot; width=&quot;400px&quot; /&gt;
```

#### Image compression plugins

Uncompressed images usually appear on content-managed websites with no [image optimisation plugins](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}. The client shouldn’t be expected to know how to compress their images, so make sure the website takes care of it automatically.

### Optimise CSS &amp; JS

Large front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap, Foundation, jQuery, Angular and React are fine on their own and can lead to faster development times, however they’re often used as a crutch for simple tasks like drop-down menus or basic animations, and include huge amounts of unused code.

#### Strip unnecessary code

Do a full audit of the frameworks and libraries that you’re using, and strip out or rewrite functionality as necessary. It goes without saying that this is easier to do at the start of a project!

Try minimal libraries like [Pure CSS](https://purecss.io/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} and [HyperApp](https://hyperapp.js.org/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}, or write your code from scratch. If you’re using Bootstrap, [customise it](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/customize/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} to reduce the file size!

#### Scrap jQuery

With the rise of CSS animations and [ES6](https://es6.io/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} JavaScript, we have powerful tools already built into browsers. If you’re pulling in 85KB of jQuery just to animate a dropdown, it’s probably time to upgrade your code!

jQuery is great for making AJAX requests easier, but if that’s all you need then [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} is even smoother to use at 4.7KB gzipped and `.fetch()` is supported natively in [all modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/#search=fetch){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} except IE11.

```javascript
// jQuery (ES5)
$.ajax({
	url: &quot;/data&quot;,
	success: function(result) {
	  doSomething(result)
	}
})

// axios (ES6)
axios.get('/data').then(result) =&gt; {
	doSomething(result)
})

// fetch (ES6)
fetch('/data').then(result) =&gt; {
	doSomething(result)
})
```

Websites like [You Might Not Need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) and [PlainJS](https://plainjs.com/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} are fantastic resources for replacing heavy libraries with small snippets of vanilla JavaScript code. If you need to boost your JS skills, [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/) has some phenomenal courses that we love and use.

#### Async load JavaScript

Most scripts aren’t necessary to render the initial page, but by default all `&lt;script&gt;` tags **force the browser to pause rendering**, download the external file and run it _before_ continuing with the page.

Move non-critical `&lt;script&gt;` tags to the footer and add an `async` property to stop them blocking the page load. This allows the browser to move on with rendering whilst sending out the request asynchronously, and the script will be run whenever it gets back from the server.

Just bear in mind that with this approach you can’t guarantee the order or time in which your scripts will be run. We prefer inlining any small scripts, which we’ll get to later.

### Reduce HTTP requests

Every external request your browser sends out takes extra time, and is affected by the latency between you and the server. On a 3G network latency can easily hit 200ms per request, so every request counts.

#### Bundle &amp; minify assets

[Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} will supercharge your front-end workflow, and it’s hard to imagine life without it. Use it to [minify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uglify){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} and pre-process your [JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-babel){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} &amp; [CSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-stylus){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}, [concatenate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-concat){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} them into a single package, [auto-inject changes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-sync){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} into your browser without reloading (absolute godsend 🙏) and a whole lot more.

We recently wrote about using Gulp to easily generate [responsive emails with MJML](https://amp.studio/blog/tutorials/2018/responsive-emails-mjml/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}, and we’ll probably do a full modern front-end workflow post in the future.

It’s a whole topic in itself, but well worth digging into. Sitepoint’s [Introduction to Gulp.js](https://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-gulp-js/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} is a good place to start.

#### Lazy load images

If you have an image-heavy site, consider [lazy loading](https://appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} them as they’re scrolled into view, otherwise they’ll be eating up the bandwidth during the initial page load that should be used for above-the-fold content. If you have a carousel banner, make sure that your code/plugin lazy loads the remaining images as they’re needed.

#### Generate a sprite sheet

If you have lots of small images or an icon set that requires multiple HTTP requests, consider packing them all into one sprite sheet. [ZeroSprites](http://zerosprites.com/) is our weapon of choice here.

This generates a single PNG file with all of your icons included, which then gets cropped using the supplied CSS classes.

```css
.sprites {
  background: url(sprites.png) no-repeat;
}
.435264 {
  width: 704px;
  height: 371px;
  background-position: 0 0;
}
.435264 {
  width: 704px;
  height: 371px;
  background-position: 0 -372px;
}
/* ...More icon classes */
```

#### Watch your WordPress plugins

WordPress (noticing a theme here?) plugins are notorious for loading masses of extra code into the browser, and it’s hard to weed them back out without breaking things. We recently came across a brand new WordPress site for an agency that _sells website development_. Here’s just one portion of the `&lt;head&gt;` code:

![How not to load website resources](/assets/img/blog/pagespeed/image-5.png &quot;How not to load website resources&quot;)

In total, there are 53 Javascript and 33 CSS files which block the page and take a full 6 seconds to load on Virgin’s fastest 400Mbit broadband, and **44 seconds** on 3G internet. The page has a 1.2 second TTFB, no `gzip` and no `Cache-Control` header so all of the assets are uncompressed and re-downloaded on every page! 😡😡😡

A staggering portion of these are coming from a single 3rd party Instagram feed plugin, yet the page has no Instagram content. 🤔

Audit your plugins!

### Prioritise visible content

Pay close attention to the order in which your CSS, JS and images are loading, and try to minimise the time it takes for the browser to render above-the-fold content. Google have [excellent advice](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} for optimising the critical render path.

#### Inline critical CSS &amp; JS

If your CSS weighs less than 100KB or so we recommend just inlining the minified version directly into the HTML using Gulp or your templating system of choice. This way the browser can instantly start laying out the page with the just first HTML response rather than waiting for an external file request to return, and the page feels much snappier as a result.

See [The Guardian’s](https://www.theguardian.com/uk){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} recently redesigned website for an example of inlining the main payload of CSS.

With this method you don’t get the benefit of having CSS cached in the browser because it’s re-downloaded on every page, but once gzipped 100KB of CSS turns into ~15KB and is transferred in an instant. We’re still seeing &lt; 200ms load times with this approach. If you’re able to separate your above-the-fold CSS and just inline that part, go for it!

We also inline most of our small JavaScript files to reduce HTTP requests and increase the overall page speed.

#### Set above-the-fold dimensions in CSS

Everybody’s tried to click on something the _instant_ after an advert or image pops in causing the page to re-arrange itself, and felt the internal rage that follows as you mash the back button too many times.

I spent hours trying to figure out why PageSpeed Insights was knocking my score down for Prioritise Visible Content, and this turned out to be the reason (and an important lesson).

If you have images above the fold, make sure the height attribute is clearly defined in your CSS. By default the browser will render the `&lt;img&gt;` element at 0 height until the image file loads, at which point it will calculate the width/height ratio and resize the element to fit, causing the page content to jump around.

![MSD vehicles website paints](/assets/img/blog/pagespeed/image-6.jpg &quot;MSD vehicles website paints&quot;)

Notice on the [MSD Vehicles](https://amp.studio/portfolio/2017/msd-vehicles/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} website how even before the text and images have loaded, the page is laid out with exactly the right dimensions to accommodate them. This doesn’t strictly make the page load faster, but it _feels_ faster once you’ve done it because the content blocks are visually in place sooner. The final paint happens in just 140ms because we’ve spent time optimising for visible content.

You can use the Network tab in Chrome’s developer tools to [capture screenshots](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} of each paint stage and analyse where content is jumping around, and try to fix the dimensions in CSS.

This also goes for advertising blocks. _Especially_ for advertising blocks.

#### Optimise the waterfall

Most browser developer tools have a Network tab that shows a waterfall graph of all the HTTP requests made whilst the tab is set to record, along with details of the file sizes, number of requests and loading times for different stages. It’s extremely useful for analysing the order in which files are requested and spotting issues.

In the Network tab, you can turn off your browser cache to force all assets to re-download and artificially limit your network speed to simulate mobile devices on 3G and see how that affects the graph.

Here’s the AMP homepage waterfall in Chrome, without the video that streams in afterwards:

![AMP homepage waterfall in Chrome](/assets/img/blog/pagespeed/image-7.png &quot;AMP homepage waterfall in Chrome&quot;)

Most of the HTTP requests are made in bulk as early as possible because they’re included in the first HTML response, resulting in a 233ms load time for this particular page.

Inlining CSS allows the browser to request background images, icons and fonts immediately, rather than waiting for the external CSS to download, parse and request the files in a second round.

This is where HTTP/2 helps massively, allowing us to process hundreds of files in one go. When using HTTP/1.1 the requests get bottlenecked and staggered across time due to a limit of 6 requests.

The 4 font files at the top load in earlier than everything else because we’ve added preload links to the `&lt;head&gt;`, before the inlined CSS. This helps the text to render as early as possible in [supported browsers](https://caniuse.com/#search=preload){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}. You can preload any files you like to get the requests sent off before the rest of the HTML or CSS is parsed.

```html
&lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot; href=&quot;/assets/fonts/ibmplexserif-semibold.woff2&quot; as=&quot;font&quot; type=&quot;font/woff2&quot;&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot; href=&quot;/assets/fonts/ibmplexserif-regular.woff2&quot; as=&quot;font&quot; type=&quot;font/woff2&quot;&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot; href=&quot;/assets/fonts/montserrat-semibold.woff2&quot; as=&quot;font&quot; type=&quot;font/woff2&quot;&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot; href=&quot;/assets/fonts/montserrat-regular.woff2&quot; as=&quot;font&quot; type=&quot;font/woff2&quot;&gt;
```

I can’t quite work out why Chrome loads in all of the favicon sizes separately at the bottom of the graph, but it doesn’t seem to affect the loading time which is marked buy a vertical red line.

### Reduce TTFB (time-to-first-byte)

TTFB measures the delay between your browser asking for a webpage and receiving the initial HTML response from the web server. A faster TTFB means that a visitor’s browser can parse the HTML and send out the requests for all of the external images and scripts earlier.

#### Cache dynamic content

In a CMS all of the page content is usually stored in a database, so this needs to be fetched, processed and dynamically placed into a template before serving the resulting HTML back to the user, increasing the TTFB.

The problem is that many websites serve exactly the same page to each user, but the server still has to **render the page every single time!** Each page can take half a second even on a fresh WordPress site with no plugins.

Using a plugin like [WP Super Cache](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} for WordPress helps to save the server from re-rendering the same content for every visitor, reducing the TTFB.

#### Check server latency

Make sure that your website is hosted in the same country that it’s being primarily accessed from to reduce the time spent waiting for a response. Our servers are in London, so we’re getting speedy ~20-30 millisecond responses to our Stoke-on-Trent office 150 miles away. There’s no set goal for ping, but lower is always better.

```bash
ping www.amp.studio
```

Using a CDN (discussed earlier) will help to reduce latency internationally.

#### Try a static site generator

For maximum performance, consider building a completely pre-rendered website from scratch with a static site generator such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;} (like this website) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/){:target=&quot;blank&quot;}. This approach offers ultimate control and speed for developers, but lacks the ability for clients to control the content.

We’ve found that some clients rarely if ever update their websites even with access to a CMS, so in these cases we prefer building static websites. The client can ask the developer to update the website on the rare occasion that it needs doing, and it’s usually cheaper for the client overall because the initial build takes less time.

You can still have dynamically generated blog posts and project pages, they’re just rendered into HTML on your development computer instead of on the server every time the page is requested. For the Twitter feed on our otherwise static homepage, we pull the data in via AJAX from a custom API.

Our own website has a ~25ms TTFB when deployed because the pages are already rendered into static HTML files, so the web server can instantly respond without processing any PHP or backend logic.

## Conclusion

Whew, that was a long one.

Hopefully this post encourages clients and developers alike to start taking speed seriously when it comes to increasing the revenue and SEO ranking of a website.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/responsive-emails-mjml-image-1.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Introducing MJML&quot; title=&quot;Introducing MJML&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, those days are (sort of) over thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mjml.io/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;MJML&lt;/a&gt;. Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.zurb.com/emails.html&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Foundation for Emails&lt;/a&gt; by Foundation, MJML is an email templating language framework that aims to simplify the way you code responsive emails, so you can focus on producing great emails without worrying as much about email client compatibility. Personally, I prefer to use MJML over Foundation for Emails because of its simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-exactly-is-mjml&quot;&gt;What Exactly is MJML?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a framework that transpiles its own simple, semantic language into production-ready HTML emails. MJML is built in &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;, and like React, utilises reusable components, which makes developing responsive email templates a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of a simple MJML column component containing some text:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html mjml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;mj-column&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;mj-text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;font-size=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;20px&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;color=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;#F45E43&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;font-family=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;helvetica&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;align=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;center&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello World&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/mj-text&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/mj-column&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s how it looks in HTML, once transpiled:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!doctype html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;xmlns=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;xmlns:v=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;xmlns:o=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!--[if !mso]&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!-- --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;http-equiv=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;IE=edge&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!--&amp;lt;![endif]--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;http-equiv=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Content-Type&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;viewport&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;style &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text/css&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, MJML syntax is simple to read, which makes it easy to learn, and it does all the hard compatibility development work for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MJML syntax is saved in a .mjml file, which you can transpile into HTML using MJML’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://mjml.io/try-it-live/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;online editor&lt;/a&gt; or by running it locally. Although it takes a few minutes to set up, I’d recommend running MJML locally because you can then use your own code editor and enhance your workflow with task runners such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://gulpjs.com/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Gulp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-getting-started-with-mjml&quot;&gt;1. Getting Started with MJML&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll guide you through the process of creating a basic responsive email in MJML locally, which involves using using &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Node JS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt; and your terminal. Don’t worry if you haven’t used Node JS, npm or your terminal before, I’ll guide you through this process. I’m using the Mac installation, but if you’re on Windows, feel free to get in touch with me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Dan_Mountford?lang=en&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; if you need some help installing Node JS, npm or MJML on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-about-node-js-and-npm&quot;&gt;2. About Node JS and npm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may know, Node JS is the revolutionary JavaScript runtime environment, built with Google’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/v8/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;V8 engine&lt;/a&gt;, that allows JavaScript to be run server-side. This means you can use Node JS to run JavaScript to carry out server-side and even local tasks to improve our development workflow. Npm, or the Node Package Manager, is used to install and manage Node JS programs, code and code dependencies such as and Gulp Babel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you already have Node and npm installed, hooray! Move to the next step. If you’re not sure, open your terminal and type node -v, then hit enter. If you get a version like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;v8.1.3&lt;/code&gt; returned, then you have Node installed. Do the same to check if you have npm installed – type npm -v into your terminal, then hit enter. If you get a version back then you also have npm installed. If you don’t have Node and npm installed, listen up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;21-installing-node-js-and-npm&quot;&gt;2.1 Installing Node JS and npm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing Node JS and npm takes minutes, go to the Node JS download page &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and click macOS Installer to download. Open up the downloaded package and follow the instructions. Once finished, you should now have Node JS and npm installed – easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-installing-and-setting-up-mjml&quot;&gt;3. Installing and Setting up MJML&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you’ve got Node JS and npm installed, you’re going to use them to install the MJML framework. First, you need a folder to install and setup our MJML development environment in. Create a new folder on your Desktop and call it &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mjml-email&lt;/code&gt;. Once your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mjml-email&lt;/code&gt; folder is on your Desktop, you need to find it in your terminal so you can install MJML inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this open up your terminal, type the following and hit enter, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-terminal highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;Desktop/mjml-email
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now your terminal directory should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-terminal highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;Defaults-MacBook-Pro:mjml-email Dan$&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep your terminal open. If you close it, make sure you’re inside your MJML folder when you reopen it before installing MJML. Now you ready to install MJML, type the following into your terminal and hit enter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-terminal highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; npm install mjml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve done that, npm will start installing some files – wait until this has finished, it shouldn’t take more than a 30 seconds. If you open up your mjml-email folder, you’ll notice that a folder called node_modules has been installed. This is the modules folder for MJML that npm has kindly installed for you. Once you’ve installed MJML, you want to initiate npm. Type the following and press enter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-terminal highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; npm init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;npm will now create a package.json file inside your mjml-email folder – this tells node what packages are used within this folder. Because the nodule_modules folder is fairly large, it’s not usually good practice to copy it to other place like a server or Github repo. Instead, you can place your package.json file on your server or in your repo and then run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; from your terminal, which will tell npm to read your package.json file and install the correct node_modules folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-building-an-email-in-mjml&quot;&gt;4. Building an Email in MJML&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have our development environment, lets create an email using MJML. First, you need to create an MJML file to create our email in. For this tutorial I’m going call the file &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;example.mjml&lt;/code&gt;. You can simple type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;touch example.mjml&lt;/code&gt; (if you closed your terminal, you will need to cd back into your mjml-email folder) in your terminal or open up your code editor and create a new file called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;example.mjml&lt;/code&gt; and save it in your mjml-email folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your example.mjml file, open it up in your code editor. For this tutorial, I’m going to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://mjml.io/try-it-live/templates/real-estate/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;this cool template&lt;/a&gt; created by &lt;a href=&quot;http://svenhaustein.de/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Sven Haustein&lt;/a&gt;. Copy the code below and paste it into your email.mjml file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html mjml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;mjml&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;mj-head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;mj-title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Say hello to RealEstate&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/mj-title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;mj-font&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Alice&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Alice&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;mj-font&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Roboto&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:400,700&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;mj-attributes&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;mj-all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;font-family=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;padding=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;0&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;mj-text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;font-weight=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;400&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;font-size=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;14&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;color=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;#000000&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;line-height=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;21px&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/mj-attributes&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/mj-head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;mj-body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;mj-container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;background-color=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;#EAE8E5&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;mj-section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;padding=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;20px 0 0 0&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;mj-column&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;mj-image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;http://nimus.de/share/tpl-realestate/box-head.png&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;align=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;center&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;border=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;none&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;padding=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;0&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/mj-image&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/mj-column&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/mj-section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/mj-text&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/mj-column&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/mj-section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/mj-container&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/mj-body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/mjml&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the MJML syntax is fairly semantic and easy to read, in comparison to a typical responsive email in html. I’m not going to go through the different MJML components in this tutorial, but do take a look at them &lt;a href=&quot;https://mjml.io/components&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the awesome customisation MJML offers out of the box (mobile menus and carousels! 😍 😍 ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save your example.mjml file and go back to your terminal. Now you can convert this MJML syntax into HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-transpiling-our-email-into-html&quot;&gt;5. Transpiling our Email into HTML&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve closed your terminal, you will need to cd into your miml-email file again (step 3). Once your’e inside your miml-email file, you will need to type the following and press enter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-terminal highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; PATH&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;:./node_modules/.bin&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This basically tells your terminal where to look for the MJML command files. If you ever close your terminal, you will have to retype this again before using and MJML commands or your terminal won’t be able to find the files required. To avoid this issue, you can add “export PATH=”$PATH:./node_modules/.bin” to your .bashrc file. This method is discussed &lt;a href=&quot;https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/260941/add-path-to-bashrc&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. To find your .bashrc file, go to your Desktop, hold shift + cmd and press “H” – this will open your user root folder. Then hold shift + cmd and press “.” – this will show all your hidden files and your .bashrc should be one of them. If you still can’t find it, you can definitely find it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.letmegooglethat.com/?q=how+to+find+bashrc+file&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If you modify your .bashrc file, you need to log out and in again or type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;source ~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; into your terminal to make it effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now try typing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mjml -V&lt;/code&gt; into your terminal and hit enter. You should get a version returned like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-terminal highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; mjml &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-V&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;3.3.5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-bash: mjml: command not found&lt;/code&gt; returned, try reinstalling MJML: Delete your node_modules folder and type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm install mjml&lt;/code&gt; into your terminal. Once you’ve done this, try repeating the previous steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can use miml commands, you will transpile our mjml file into HTML. Open your termina, type the following and hit enter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-terminal highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; mjml example.mjml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now open up your miml-email folder and you’ll notice there’s a file called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;example.html&lt;/code&gt; in there. Open this file up in your browser and you’ll see that MJML has converted your example.mjml file into a responsive email. Even better, open up the example.html file in your code editor and you’ll notice that all those pesky inline styles, conditional comments and nested tables have been generated by MJML. All hail MJML,The Saviour! Now try this: Type the following into your terminal and hit enter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-terminal highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; mjml &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; example.mjml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will now tell MJML to transpile a minified HTML email, ready for testing. There’s multiple commands to help you with your email development workflow built in with MJML, take a look &lt;a href=&quot;https://mjml.io/documentation/#mjml-guides&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Another cool command is -w:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-terminal highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; mjml &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-w&lt;/span&gt; example.mjml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tells MJML to watch your example.mjml file for changes, so when you save your file, it automatically generates your HTML. This is nice because you can work on your email in your code editor, save, and refresh your HTML file in your browser to see any changes. MJML also works really well with Gulp, which you can use to enhance your workflow further with automatic browser refreshing etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-words&quot;&gt;Final Words&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this tutorial has helped you to see the good side of responsive email development. As always, I’d highly recommend testing all your emails before sending either with &lt;a href=&quot;https://litmus.com/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Litmus&lt;/a&gt; or Litmus’s free email sending tool &lt;a href=&quot;https://putsmail.com/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;PutsMail&lt;/a&gt;.

Since the 1960s, [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) have favoured Helvetica as their favoured type family – until now. [Mike Abbink](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-abbink-8550072/), Executive Creative Director of Brand Experience and Design at IBM, along with an in-house team have developed a completely new type family to replace Helvetica across the IBM's visual identity. Say hello to [IBM Plex](https://github.com/IBM/type).

## Getting Back on Track

IBM initially chose Helvetica as their global type family at the beginning of the computing era, which was considered to be &quot;the future&quot; (we can't argue with that!). Now in 2018, Helvetica is the most popular corporate typeface on the planet and computing technology has taken over – the future is here! But what does this mean for IBM? Has their initial ambitious, modernist story been obscured? Maybe. IBM Plex aims to regain its typeface mojo with the release of a new, mechanical-inspired typeface that has the flexibility of Helvetica but the personality of IBM.

## Introducing IBM Plex

IBM has been in the making for over 2 years, and we can see why – It's comprehensive and full of flavour. IBM need a typeface that can go across the board: packaging, print, digital and online, so IBM Plex comes in 3 styles (sans, sans-serif and mono-sans) each with 8 line weights, in homage to the eight-bar IBM logo.

### What Do We Think?

Yes. We love it. We've even incorporated IBM Plex into our branding at AMP. The mechanical, tech-inspired, super usable type family is perfect for a group of nerdy designers and developers like us (they even designed a mono-sans so we can have a pretty new typeface to develop with!). We love new technology at AMP and think our story shares similarities to that of IBM.

### IBM Plex is Free to Use!

Yes, IBM have open-sourced their new typeface, so head over to the IBM Plex [Github page](https://github.com/IBM/type) and try it out for yourself.</content><author><name>[{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Dan Mountford&quot;}, {&quot;img&quot;=&gt;&quot;dan-thumb1.jpg&quot;}]</name></author><summary type="html">Since the 1960s, IBM have favoured Helvetica as their favoured type family – until now.
